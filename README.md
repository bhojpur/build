# Bhojpur Build - Management Engine

The `Bhojpur Build` is a proprietary software build engine for several programming languages
applied within the [Bhojpur.NET Platform](https://github.com/bhojpur/platform/) for delivery
of distributed `applications` or `services`.

## Simple Usage

For example, to generate the `Go` programming language bindings for the `Android`, you can
use the following command in a new Terminal window.

```bash
buildc2go pkg/cpp/template/android.yml
```
